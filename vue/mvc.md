# MVC

Theory

```
- Low coupling
- High cohesion, separating presentation concerns from the model
- Simultaneous development is possible; due to the existence of many layers, people can work in parallel on a task
- Ease of change; because of how things are separated, adding future concepts or making alterations becomes easier 
```

# Model

> This is the crucial part of the application. This does not rely on any specific user interface but more defines the domain in which you operate. Rules, logic, and data live here.

# View

That is possible to make different purposed views derived from the same data. Say an admin, user and a manager interface for the same product.
